Predicting whether a mammogram mass is benign or malignant
- Using a publicly availble dataset, a model was created using 10 cells of the Jupyter notebook in order to predict 
whether a given mammogram mass was cancerous or not. 

Neurogenomics
- Several different studies used statistical methods to aggregate findings and cluster data in order to make
sense of information. This presentation broadly explains the field of neurogenomics and some applications. Personally worked on a few
studies. 

Web Scraping with Python Example (Graphics Cards)
- Using any given public website that allows web scraping and parsing, it is easy to obtain needed information. This saves
a tremendous amount of time and therefore adds business value. Users can check the Robots.txt of a website to check if 
web scraping/web parsing of the website is allowed.
